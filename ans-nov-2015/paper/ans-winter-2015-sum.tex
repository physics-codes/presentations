\section{Introduction}

We present a syllabus for teaching scientific computing best practices to
university students in nuclear science and engineering.  This course is modeled after the
book, ``Effective Computation in Physics: A Field Guide to Research in
Python`` \cite{scopatz_effective_2015} and uses that work as the course
textbook.

This summary will first motivate the need for modernized university-level nuclear
engineering curriculum in scientific software development and data analysis
from the perspective of modern best practices.  Next, this summary will introduce
the project-driven content and timeline for the course as well as the
collaborative nature of lesson content itself. Finally, the success of
similar training will be discussed along with a schedule of future pilots of
the course.

\section{Motivation}

Nuclear engineering is an exceptionally computational field. Indeed, in the very early
days of computing,  nuclear applications drove the majority of innovation
in computers, computation, and scientific simulation \cite{rhodes_making_2012}. Today's nuclear
engineering students, however, are not as poised to become leaders in computing,
as was once the case.
In part, this is due to the regulatory climate in nuclear engineering which
necessitates the use of battle-hardened software implemented in legacy
programming languages. Accordingly, modern programming languages absent from
our curriculum, and so too are the modern
best practices in scientific software development \cite{wilson_best_2014} that
have evolved alongside them.

Nuclear engineering once led the world in computing and has fallen behind, but
not because the challenges have gotten easier. In fact, nuclear engineering
applications continue to rely on enormous datasets in many
dimensions, traverse disparate scales, incorporate many physics, and demand
precision.

%Typical nuclear data typically takes the form of large libraries involving
%tabulated and evaluated data representing neutron, charged particle, and atomic
%reaction probabilities for all of the more than three thousand known
%radionuclides.

For example, the driving equation for neutron behavior, the time-dependent
Boltzmann equation, is solved in a 7-dimensional phase space, ($3$ in space, $2$
in angle, and one each in energy and time). The scale of a nuclear reactor
simulation is therefore inherently large, spanning five orders of magnitude in space and
ten in neutron energy. Resolved discretization across those scales would require
over $10^{17}$ degrees of freedom per timestep, well beyond the
capabilities of even exascale computing. In this way, without sophisticated
data and analysis methods, we would run out of computational resources before
heat transport, fluid flow, or material performance in the reactor had even
been addressed.

Faced with data and simulation scales such as these, it is imperative
that nuclear engineering students are prepared to reclaim a leadership role in
cutting edge scientific computation. Equipping the next generation of
students with effective computational skills will certainly lead to breakthrough
advancements in nuclear engineering research and development.
Specifically, training them in best practices already commonplace in commercial
software development could have an enormous impact on reproducibility in
nuclear science and engineering. Thus equipped, their contributions to nuclear
engineering may even have a revitalizing effect on the field.

\subsection{Modern Programming Languages}

Due to our reliance on legacy software, the undergraduate first course in
computing at many Nuclear Engineering departments emphasizes Fortran
rather the modern equivalents, Python and C++. Studies have shown that
productivity in a high-level language (like Python).

Python programming scales to meet the demands of high performance computing applications.

\subsection{Efficient and Reproducible Workflows}

Best practices for efficient and reproducible modeling and analysis, though
common in commercial software development, are typically missing from nuclear
engineering curriculum as well. A similar lack of such workflows across
academic science at large and is  at the root of an enormous credibility
crisis in scientific computing \cite{donoho, stodden}.

\subsection{Open Source and Open Science}

Computational tools and data grow more robust with a broad base of users and
developers \cite{petre_code_2014, wicherts_willingness_2013}. The physics
community has used this fact to the great benefit of, for example, the Large
Hadron Collider experiment. In that instance, faced with an enormous computing
challenge and potential for human error, the experimenters opened both the
software and the data to the whole world. This massive scale peer review is
unknown in nuclear where a combination of export control issues and antiquated
workflow paradigms mean that only a very small number of tools have been open
sourced \cite{moose}\cite{pyne}\cite{cyclus}.

Since Python is open source, students are able to use it more flexibly and for
free than alternative high-level frameworks, like MATLAB.

\section{Course Recommendations}

\subsection{Content}
To train the workforce in a authors recommend a course covering the topics
above in a high level language (Python). A twelve week course with two days per
week would have the following schedule:

\section{Experience}

\subsection{Software Carpentry}

The material and concepts proposed here were heavily influence by the work done
by the Software Carpentry Foundation, an organization that

Software Carpentry has been involved with teaching scientific computing best
practices for over a decade. Students have come from many areas of science and
usually no programming experience is necessary to attend a course. The courses
are typically two days and cover skills for "Doing more with less pain."

Also, the testing, debugging, and collaboration sessions were taught as a part
of a recent workshop at the University of California Berkeley. The students, in
the course of four hours, were able to upload tests and example code to a
version controlled repository and to deploy continuous integration for
automated unit testing.

\section{Conclusions}

This course will equip students with modern concepts that will make them more
effective researchers in the data and computing intensive domain of nuclear
engineering. These concepts include modules for :

\begin{itemize}
\item getting started with a modern, high-level, object-oriented programming language,
\item getting nuclear engineering work done with sophisticated library design employing powerful data structures,
\item getting correct results by employing workflows that emphasize tests and capture provenance,
\item getting work publication ready with the help of modern computing.
\end{itemize}

By emphasizing projects along the way, the students in this course will learn
to create free and open source tools, verify the functioning of those tools,
and publish them online.  Finally, the syllabus and course textbook are open
and affordable, respectively.
